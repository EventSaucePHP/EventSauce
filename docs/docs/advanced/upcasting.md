Event sourcing is a great discovery tool, it also provides a
solid basis to perform system introspection. By analysing streams
of events you can come to great new insights. Sometimes different
events are needed to better express what has happened. Instead of
handling two types of events and handling each of them separately
**upcasting** can be used to transform messages at runtime. This
prevents from having to alter previously persisted events at a minor
expense.

In EventSauce _upcasting_ is facilitated in the serialization
process. The `EventSauce\EventSourcing\Upcasting\UpcastingMessageSerializer`
can be used to add one or more upcasting transformations.

Each upcaster must implement the `EventSauce\EventSourcing\Upcasting\Upcaster`
interface:

```php
<?php

namespace EventSauce\EventSourcing\Upcasting;

use Generator;

interface Upcaster
{
    public function upcast(array $message): Generator;
}
```

Because of the use of PHP **generators** upcasting is simple but very
powerful. Generators allow you to iterate over a collection without
_holding_ the entire collection. A generator can choose to omit, to remove
irrelevant events from the stream, or break up events and emit multiple
more fine-grained ones.

## Using multiple upcasters

You can use multiple upcasters using the `UpcasterChain`.

```php
<?php

use EventSauce\EventSourcing\Upcasting\UpcasterChain;
use EventSauce\EventSourcing\Upcasting\UpcastingMessageSerializer;

$upcastingSerializer = new UpcastingMessageSerializer(
    $actualSerializer,
    new UpcasterChain(new UpcasterOne(), new UpcasterTwo())
);
```
