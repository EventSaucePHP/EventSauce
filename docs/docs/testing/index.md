Event sourced applications are very easy to test. EventSauce ships with test tooling
that allows for scenario based testing using a given/when/then structure. This kind
testing is often associated with Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

Tests written in this style are very expressive and easy to read. This makes it
simple to document business requirements. The test tooling also makes it easy
to follow the TDD approach. Creating tests (and the required events) often gives
very usable insights when modeling your application.

### Create your own tooling!

Although EventSauce ships with its own set of test tooling, you're encouraged to
create your own. Every domain is different. Analyse your workflow and optimize
common cases. Tackling a problem over and over? Try creating tooling for it!

## 1. Create a base test case for your aggregate.

It's advised to create a base test for your aggregate. This base class sets up the defaults
for all test cases around the aggregate. There are a couple of methods that need to be implemented:

* `newAggregateRootId` is expected to return an aggregate root ID
* `aggregateRootClassName` for the fully qualified aggregate root class name
* `handle` executes the `when` input, usually by passing a command object to a method on the aggregate

You can choose to setup a _handle_ method in your base test case or per test case.
If you use a command-bus based interaction you'll want to set it up in your base class.

```php
use EventSauce\EventSourcing\AggregateRootId;
use EventSauce\EventSourcing\TestUtilities\AggregateRootTestCase;

abstract class SignUpProcessTestCase extends AggregateRootTestCase
{
    protected function newAggregateRootId(): AggregateRootId
    {
        return SignupId::create();
    }

    protected function aggregateRootClassName(): string
    {
        return SignUpProcess::class;
    }
    
    protected function handle(/* your arguments for when */)
    {
        // Implement me.
    }
}
```

In event-sourcing it's common to use `commands` as instructions for your system. You
can use the `aggregateRootId` method to obtain a fixated ID (generated by your
`newAggregateRootId` method). If done this way you can obtain the aggregate root like
this:

```php
use EventSauce\EventSourcing\TestUtilities\AggregateRootTestCase;

abstract class SignUpProcessTestCase extends AggregateRootTestCase
{
    // ...

    protected function handle(object $command)
    {
        if ($command instanceof SomeCommand) {
            $aggregate = $this->repository->retrieve($command->id());
            $aggregate->performAction();
            $this->repository->persist($aggregate);
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Create test scenarios

Now that you've got your base class it's time to set up test scenarios. It's advised to
create small, focused test cases that handle a specific task or condition.

For instance, initiating a sign-up process:

```php
class InitiatingSignUpProcessTest extends SignUpProcessTestCase
{
    /**
     * @test
     */
    public function initiating_a_sign_up_process()
    {
        $processId = $this->aggregateRootId();

        $this->when(new InitiateSignUpProcess(
            $processId,
        ))->then(new SignUpProcessWasInitiated());
    } 
}
```

The `when` call takes the input needed to `handle` our scenario. The `then` clause specifies
one or more events that we expect to be recorded afterwards.

In some cases you'll want to record multiple events from a single interaction, this is also
possible:

```php
$this->when(new InitiateSignUpProcess(
    $processId
))->then(
    new SignUpProcessWasInitiated(),
    new AnotherThingHappened()
);
```

If we don't expect something to happen, we can also express that. This allows you to test for
idempotent handling of events:

```php
class InitiatingSignUpProcessTest extends SignUpProcessTestCase
{
    /**
     * @test
     */
    public function not_recording_events()
    {
        $processId = $this->aggregateRootId();

        $this->when(new UneventfulCommand(
            $processId,
        ))->thenNothingShouldHaveHappened();
    }
}
```

The `handle` implementation for this command looks something like:

```php
abstract class SignUpProcessTestCase extends AggregateRootTestCase
{
    protected function handle($command)
    {
        $process = $this->repository->retrieve($command->processId());
        
        if ($command instanceof InitiateSignUpProcess) {
            $process->initiate();           
        }
        
        $this->repository->persist($process);
    }
}
```
